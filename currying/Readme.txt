Currying:

currying is a technique of evaluating function with multiple arguments,into sequence of functions with single
 arguments. in other words,when Afunction, instead of taking all arguments at one time. takes the first one and
return a new function that takes the second one and return new function which takes the
thirdone,and so fourth, untill all arguments have been fullfilled.

=>it helps to avoid passing same variable again and again.
=> it is extemily useful in event handling.
