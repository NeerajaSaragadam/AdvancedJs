Promise:

A promise is used to handle the asynchronous result of an operation. javascript is designed to not wait for an 
asynchronous block of code to completely excute before other synchronous part of the code can run. with promise we
can defer the execution of a code block until an async result is comppleted. this way other operation can keep 
running without interruption.

=> in javascript, a promise is a good way to handle the asynchronous operation. it is used to find out if the asynchronous
operation is successfully completed or not.
